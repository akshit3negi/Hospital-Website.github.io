Project Hospital Management System includes the registration of patients.

Users can search for the availability of a doctor and the details of a patient using the ID. The Hospital Management System can be entered using a username and password.

It is accessible either by an administrator or the patient itself. The interface is very user-friendly.

It has mainly two modules. One is at the Administration Level and the other one is for users i.e. patients and doctors. The Application maintains authentication to access the application.
